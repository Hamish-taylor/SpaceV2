This is a game project i made for my first year engineering computer graphics paper.

Description:
This game was modeled off of another game by the name of "StarBound",
but currently only consists of basic procedurally generated levels with slight terrain modifiers
I wrote this game in processing and have no plans to ever update it past this point.
All code and assets were created by me.
Feel free to go through the code and critique it, i am still learning after all :)
